## Overview

Challenge to replicate NFT card.

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

I built out the main card before working on the hover states.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my first time combining flexbox column containers with flex box row containers and I definitely feel a lot more confident using flexbox now.

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to adding more functionality to my projects.
